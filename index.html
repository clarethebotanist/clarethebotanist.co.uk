   				<h4>
   				I am a botanist specialising in <b>bryophytes</b> (mosses and liverworts) and have a particular interest in upland vascular plants. I am available to carry out a range of plant <a href="services.htm">surveys</a> across Scotland and northern England.
   				</h4> 

   				<p> I have <b>eight years</b> of botanical field survey experience working across Scotland 
   				and northern England. For the past four years I have worked freelance on 
   				a range of projects for a variety of organisations including; bryophyte surveys for proposed 
   				hydro-electric schemes and SNH, site condition monitoring for the National Trust for Scotland, 
   				NVC surveys as a sub-contractor for environmental consultancies and helping with vegetation surveys 
   				for University research projects. Prior to this I worked for the RSPB and the National Trust for Scotland at 
   				Ben Lawers NNR carrying out a range of plant and habitat surveys. I have a BSc in Biological Sciences Plant Science honours from the University of Edinburgh. 
   				</p>
   
    			<p> <b>Conservation</b> of plants and habitats is very important to me. I am driven by the 
   				knowledge that the work I carry out in the field contributes to management decisions of 
   				the site and may lead to targeted conservation or regeneration of particular species or 
   				habitats. 
   				</p>
   				
   				<p><b> I am committed to carrying out high quality, accurate, reliable work. </b></p>

   				<p> I am an active member of the <b>British Bryological Society</b> (<a href="http://www.britishbryologicalsociety.org.uk/#" target="BBS">BBS</a>), I am the Vice County recorder for Fife and attend regular field meetings 
   				including to the Isle of Eigg, the Yorkshire Dales, Angus, Sutherland, northern Cumbria, Wester Ross based in Kinlochewe, the mountains of mid Perthshire and Mweelrea in County Mayo.
