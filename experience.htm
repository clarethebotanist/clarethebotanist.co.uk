				<b>Other</b>
				<p>Vegetation survey at the planning stage for a commercial site near Carnforth - the company was interested in the conservation potential of an area of reed bed on their site that was not going to be developed.</p>
				<br>
				<h3> 2008-<a name="2010"></a>2010 - Ben Lawers NNR </h3>

				<p> I spent three seasons at <a href="http://www.nts.org.uk/Property/Ben-Lawers-National-Nature-Reserve/#" target="_NTS"> Ben Lawers</a>, the first volunteering carrying out a range of tasks including snow pearlwort monitoring, tree nursery work, bird surveys for the BTO Atlas and grazing pressure surveys. The second and third seasons I was employed as the seasonal ecologist which involved carrying out and reporting <b>Site Condition Monitoring of habitats</b>, <b>detailed surveys of vascular plant species</b> and watervole and red squirrel surveys. The habitats that I surveyed were Alpine Calcareous grassland, Alkaline Fen, Blanket Bog, montane Willow scrub and Dry heath. The plant species that I surveyed were <i>Carex microglochin</i>, <i>Veronica fruticans</i>, <i>Kobresia simpliciuscula</i> and <i>Sagina nivalis</i>.  I also helped on bryophyte surveys looking for <i>Timmia austriaca</i>, <i>Bryoerythrophyllum caledonicum</i> and <i>Hypnum revolutum</i>. </p>
